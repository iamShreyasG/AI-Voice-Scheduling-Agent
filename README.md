# AI-Voice-Scheduling-Agent
A real-time voice scheduling assistant that interacts with users conversationally and creates meetings directly in Google Calendar after confirmation.

---

## Overview

This project implements a voice-based AI assistant that:

* Initiates a conversation with the user
* Collects meeting details using natural language
* Confirms details before scheduling
* Creates a real Google Calendar event
* Works through a deployed backend URL

---

## Features

* Voice-driven conversation flow
* Natural language date and time handling
* Automatic conversion to calendar-compatible formats
* Google Calendar event creation
* Secure backend integration

---

## Deployed Backend URL

```
https://miss-resiniferous-bethany.ngrok-free.dev
```

This URL is connected to the voice agent for scheduling meetings.

---

## How to Test the Agent

1. Open the voice agent interface
2. Speak naturally (no specific format required)

   * Example:

     * “My name is Shreyas”
     * “Tomorrow”
     * “10:30 in the morning”
     * “Project discussion”
3. Confirm the details when the assistant repeats them
4. The meeting is automatically added to Google Calendar
